<p>So far, this course has introduced you to the policy analysis process. It has prepared you to analyze a problem methodically and objectively and to develop alternative solutions for solving it. It has taught you to assemble and use the best possible evidence, and to consider and present important aspects that influence the direction of the decision at hand.</p>

<p>You have most likely taken this course because you are interested in public policy and the policy making process, and you are considering or have embarked on a career as a policy analyst. Who knows, some day you may assume the decision-making role in which you will use analyses provided by your policy staff.</p> 

<p>Before you leave this course, I want to say a few words about your role as a policy analyst. Your contribution is central to decision-makers’ efforts to arrive at good decisions.</p> 

<p>You are responsible for providing a clear and organized structure for analyzing problems and considering solutions. Doing so will assist policy makers, stakeholders, and advocates as they consider various policy alternatives objectively and comprehensively. You will be helping all parties consider crucial aspects of a policy, including scientific evidence, economic consequences, social effects, political ramifications, and trade-offs. If you do your job well, decision-makers will be able to weigh the risk and benefits of the policy options without undue sway from the emotional pleas that occur in the absence of organized and clearly presented evidence.</p>

<p>Your job is also to create a framework and a language that can overcome the chasm between the scientist and the lay person. Your analysis of public health policy options often requires information from epidemiologists, economists, behavioral scientists, and other disciplines.</p> 

<p>The data you use to populate your policy framework may appear alien or arcane to many decision-makers and the general public: attributable risk, mortality, and return on investment. Assembling this information into a clear, incisive analysis can be challenging but you must do so to reach a well-made decision.</p> 

<p>Often, when conducting a policy analysis, you are attempting to project into the future. You have to be careful not to create a false sense of certainty when projecting decision outcomes and recommending a course of action. Be clear about the assumptions you have made that have led you to the results you have achieved. </p>

<p>Presenting the results of different scenarios may also be important. Having a better understanding of the nature of the uncertainty in the analysis and the associated risks may lead to different decision choices.</p> 

<p>There are limits to your job as a policy analyst. You can't let considerations of politics and political risk affect the structure, inputs, and the results of the policy analysis. You must present your policy analysis objectively and comprehensively. The analysis must be able to stand up to scientific scrutiny and identify all elements that influence the decision, including political risk, timing, stakeholder support, and opposition analysis. You may be asked for a recommended option and to justify that recommendation on the basis of your analysis. It then becomes the decision-maker’s responsibility to weigh all the factors and make the final decision.</p> 

<p>Remember, good decisions require team work. The policy analyst is one of the most critical members of that team. This course should prepare you for that role.</p>
