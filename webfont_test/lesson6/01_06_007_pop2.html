<h1 class="popTitle">Questions</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Are the policy options addressing incremental or comprehensive change? Is one more important to you than another?</li> 
  <li>Are there certain stakeholder groups that are a target population?  Different policy options can be utilized by different stakeholders.</li> 
  <li>Is the option appropriate for the particular funding mechanism? If not, what mechanism is it appropriate for? </li>
  <li>What are the timing parameters? Will this policy change occur at a pace that is acceptable to stakeholders and others involved?</li>
</ol>

<p>Answering these questions will assist you in the prioritization process. As you have probably noticed, some of the questions are subjective. Well informed policy analysts can disagree on certain points.</p>
 
<p>For example, one person may think that policy options addressing comprehensive change should be the priority, while another may feel that in the long run, incremental change is more likely to be integrated into practice. Consequently, she prioritizes the option that will change policy incrementally. This leads us to the next topic: professional judgment. </p>
