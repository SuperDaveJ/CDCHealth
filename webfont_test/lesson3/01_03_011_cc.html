<p>Recently, my research team was studying the problem that the rate of prenatal care for pregnant women in a specific region of a city was well below the average for that city, and far from the Healthy People 2020 goal. Through a review of the literature, we learned that risk factors for not getting prenatal care include low educational level and low income.</p>
  
<p>The demographic data for the target area revealed that many women did have these risk factors; however, the rates of that particular area were still much lower than other areas of town where the same risk factors existed. This was where we needed to move beyond data and ask a stakeholder to help unravel the mystery of the low rates of prenatal care in the target area.</p>

<p>In this particular situation, when we reviewed the clinic data, it revealed a spike in the “no-show” rate for prenatal appointments in the previous years. After many interviews with providers and community members, we learned that bus service in the area had been drastically cut in the last two years. Elimination of bus routes was strongly correlated with the spike in “no show” rates which was correlated to low rates of prenatal care. For this situation, stakeholders were able to fill in the gaps and provide us with information we needed to create a policy option that was applicable to this specific context. The policy option turned out to be a transportation recommendation!</p>
