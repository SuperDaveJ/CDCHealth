<h1 class="popTitle">Problem Statement</h1>

<p>A problem statement is one that defines the  &ldquo;who, what, when, where, and how&rdquo; of the problem.</p>

<p>For example, returning to the example about teen  drinking and driving used earlier in the lesson, based on the research the  analyst conducted, she could have written a problem statement such as the  following:</p>

<p>Although fewer teens are  drinking and driving, this risky behavior is still a major threat. Drinking and  driving among teens in the U.S. has gone down by 54% since 1991; however, high  school teens still drive after drinking about 2.4 million times per month. 1 in  5 teen drivers involved in fatal crashes had some alcohol in their system. 81%  of these drivers had blood alcohol concentrations higher than the legal limit  for adults.</p>
