<p>Most likely, the problem you are studying has been addressed by experts in a university, government agency, or non-government organization. Literature searches can often yield important background information, research results and case study findings. CDC employees are often familiar with sources such as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), a variety of medical databases, and other standard academic research tools. However, many other, often less familiar, sources can also be very helpful when you are assembling evidence for a policy analysis.</p>

<p>Some example document sources include, but are not limited to, peer reviewed literature, white papers from conferences, briefs from reputable sources, statistics from CDC, government reports, and position papers. Newspapers and magazines are also important documents for a policy analyst to review.</p>
  
<p>For example, if HAIs were the focus,   CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network website would be a good place to go for documents and sources.</p>
 
<p style="font-style:italic;">You can find the link to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network website in the resources section of this lesson. </p>
