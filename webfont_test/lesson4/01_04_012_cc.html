<p>In response to legislative requests, a state-funded public health institute created a legislator certificate program for lawmakers who want to improve their understanding of health and health care.</p>

<p>The objectives of the program are to develop a cadre of legislators with more in-depth knowledge and understanding of health policy issues, and to use systems thinking to encourage broader and more systemic approaches to policymaking. The systems thinking is an important piece of the learning for the legislators and their staff. It involves gaining a deep understanding of the &ldquo;root&rdquo; of a health problem, and how that problem can be impacted. For example, in one session where the focus was on childrenâ€™s behavioral health, the legislators began peeling back the layers of the problem and after much discussion realized that children with behavioral problems were often children whose parents had been part of the criminal justice system, and that some of the current policies intended to punish adults also have long lasting impacts on their children.
</p> 

<p>Several legislators determined that a closer examination of some of the state&rsquo;s criminal justice policies was needed, and during the examination, there should be a mindset of whether policies could be shifted to better support families. The idea was that in doing so, children&rsquo;s behavioral health would also be impacted.</p>
