<h1 class="popTitle">Fiscal and economic impact</h1>

<p style="font-style:italic;">How does the cost to enact, implement, and enforce the policy compare with the value of the benefits?</p>

<p>Quantifying fiscal and economic impact of a policy is becoming increasingly important in comparing and contrasting the benefits of policy options. Here are some things to think about when analyzing an option for health impact (this is not an exhaustive list):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cost analysis – analyzes the program or implementation costs and cost of illness associated with a policy option. </li>
  <li>Cost-effectiveness analysis – compares both the costs and health outcomes of alternative policy options. </li>	
  <li>Cost-utility analysis – a form of cost-effectiveness analysis that uses quality-adjusted health outcomes, such as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) or Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).</li>
  <li>Cost-benefit analysis – standardizes both costs and benefits in dollars and compares all costs against all benefits during a specified period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thinking about these things can help you describe relevant economic implications of policy options to decision-makers where appropriate.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">For more information on this topic, see the overview of economic evaluation in this lesson’s resources.</p>
