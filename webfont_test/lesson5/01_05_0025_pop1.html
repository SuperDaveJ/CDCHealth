<h1 class="popTitle">Impact on Public Health</h1>

<p style="font-style:italic;">How will the policy impact risk factors, protective factors, morbidity, and mortality?</p>

<p>The criteria of &ldquo;impact on public health&rdquo; will be informed by your work on collecting, comparing, and synthesizing the data and information from many different sources as discussed in Lesson 3. When using this criterion, you are given an opportunity to look at the risk and protective factors, morbidity, and mortality from a perspective of equity; that is, you can conduct an assessment of whether the policy option will have a differential impact on segments of the population.</p>
 
<p>For example, will this policy impact adults in rural communities differently than it will those in urban settings? Will children be differentially impacted? If so, are there ways to mitigate any negative impact?</p>

<p>Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a good tool to help you determine the potential differential impact of a policy on various populations.</p>

<p>You can learn more about this tool by visiting the HIA link in this lesson's resources.</p>
