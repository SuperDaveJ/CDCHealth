<p>Legal feasibility</p>
<ul>
  <li>How does the policy comply with constitutional, statutory, or common law rights?</li>
  <li>Who is authorized to make decisions about policy implementation?</li>
</ul>

<p>Political feasibility</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the experiences of other jurisdictions?</li>
  <li>What are the current political forces, including political history, environment, and policy debate? </li>
  <li>Who are the stakeholders, including supporters    and opponents?Â  What are their    interests and values?</li>
  <li>What are the potential social, educational,    and cultural perspectives associated with the policy option (e.g. lack of    knowledge, fear of change, force of habit)? </li>
  <li>What are the potential impacts of the policy    on other sectors and high-priority issues (e.g., sustainability, economic    impact)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Operational feasibility</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who is responsible for implementing and    enforcing the policy? Is there existing capacity?</li>
  <li>How much time is needed for the policy to be    enacted, implemented, and enforced? </li>
  <li>How scalable, flexible, and transferable is    the policy?</li>
  <li>Are there any other potential barriers for    developing, enacting, or implementing the policy (e.g., capacity, resources,    technical)?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: In assessing feasibility, it is important to identify critical    barriers that will prevent the policy from being developed, enacted, or    implemented at the current time. For such policies, it may not be worthwhile    to spend a lot of time analyzing other factors (e.g., fiscal and economic    impact). However, by identifying these critical barriers, you can be more    readily able to identify when they shift and how to act quickly when there is    a window of opportunity.</em></p>
