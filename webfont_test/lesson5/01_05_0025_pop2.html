<h1 class="popTitle">Feasibility</h1>

<p style="font-style:italic;">What is the likelihood that the policy can be adopted and implemented?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal feasibility - The policy cannot violate constitutional, statutory, or common law rights; it also must be within the realm of authority of the decision-making authority to implement.</li>
   
  <li>Political feasibility - A policy which faces strong political opposition may not be feasible to implement, even if it is widely perceived as being legal. Social and cultural contexts vary greatly in different areas. A policy that galvanizes opposition in a particular location may be more acceptable in a different place.  For example, while motorcycle helmet laws are supported in many states, helmet laws are not always accepted and have been politically unfeasible in some states.  However, remember that this criterion is not static&mdash;cultural shifts can occur that cause a policy to be accepted where it was previously opposed. When this happens, a window of opportunity may exist.</li>

  <li>Operational feasibility - It is also important to understand the robustness of a policy&mdash;how it will &ldquo;hold up&rdquo; during an involved implementation process, which has administrative complexities or delays. Does the implementing authority have the expertise and resources necessary to implement the policy?</li>
</ul>
