<p>In 2007, representatives from CDC created a Transportation Policy Group to develop a more comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing issues related to transportation and health.</p>
  
<p>This group <em>identified and engaged relevant stakeholders</em> such as the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as non-federal partners such as the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the Healthy Eating, Active Living Convergence Partnership.</p>

<p>Together, they then identified and defined the problem: The current U.S. transportation infrastructure focuses on motor vehicle travel and provides limited support for other transportation options for most Americans. </p>

<p>They further <em>defined the implications of this problem with data from the literature</em>, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px;">Physical activity and active transportation have declined compared to previous generations.  The lack of physical activity is a major contributor to the steady rise in rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and other chronic health conditions in the United States.</p>

<p>Increased motor vehicle transportation has led to increased accidents for pedestrians and bicyclists. </p>

<p>They set a goal to identify and describe policy options that could expand the availability of, safety for, and access to a variety of transportation options and integrate health-enhancing choices into transportation policy.</p>

<p>Next, they <em>assessed the policy options according to their health and fiscal impacts</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, in 2010, <em>they identified and published evidence-based policy recommendations</em> as a framework for policymakers to consider in order to strengthen transportation policies and programs by including public health and safety. You will find a link to the recommendations in this lessonâ€™s resource list.</p>
