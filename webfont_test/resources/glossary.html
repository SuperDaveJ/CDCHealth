<p><span class="term">Combining Options: </span>Combining options is a creative way to pull the highest ranking components from various options and create something new.  When this process is used, existing options can be improved. For example, an option that ranks highly overall but has low scores on criteria A and B can be modified with ideas from options that score well on A and B. This combining and improving can be done for every option, and then the policy analysis table can be used again to evaluate the new options.</p>
